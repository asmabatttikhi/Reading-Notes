## boxes CSS
### Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
* You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
1. at first the size of the box as size of the content 
2. pixles control the size of the box , percentage based on the size of browser window , ems the size of the text inside it.
3. `min-width, max-width ` when the browser stretches not to effect the lines of text.
4. `min-height, max-height `  If the box is not big enough to hold the content, and the content expands outside the box it can look very messy.
* **overflow** ,`overflow: hidden;` , `hidden` or `scroll` to fix if content larger than box
* You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
* It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
* Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
* Legibility can be improved by controlling the width ofboxes containing text and the leading.
* CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.
## Decisions and Loops js
### Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)

* Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
* switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
* There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements
